Cis-regulatory divergence of eloF drives reproductive isolation in Drosophila 
============

Abstract
---
The differential production of pheromones is a major barrier to mating between
species in _Drosophila_. Individuals from morphologically similar sister species
can produce different sets of cuticular hydrocarbons that allow potential mates
to identify them as a suitable partner. In order to elucidate cis-regulatory
mechanisms behind speciation of the sister species _D. simulans_ and _D.
sechellia_, we looked for allele-specific expression in hydrocarbon producing
oenocytes from F1 hybrids of the two species. When we screened RNAi knockdowns
of genes with tissue- and allele-specific expression, we found that one of
them, the fatty acid elongase _eloF_, broadly affects both the complement of
hydrocarbons present on females and the propensity of _D. simulans_ males to mate
with those females.



History

This code actually represents a re-analysis of the RNA-seq data in (PUBLICATION
FORTHCOMING).  Identification of _eloF_, among other genes, was made on the
basis allele-specific and tissue-specific expression analyses performed in the
Fall of 2015.  Sober examination of the code in the spring of 2018 revealed a
number of weaknesses in the analysis, which were corrected using more rigorous
analysis.
